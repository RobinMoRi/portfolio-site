      <p class="p-text-secondary w-10">
        With a master's degree in mechatronics and robotics from the Royal
        Institute of Technology, I come most recently from Morpheus Tribe, where
        I work as a fullstack developer.
      </p>
      <p class="p-text-secondary w-10">
        I have over 4 years of hands-on experience working with a diverse range
        of technologies, encompassing web development, business process
        automation, data analytics, and test development.
      </p>
      <p class="p-text-secondary w-10">
        What truly sets me apart is my unwavering passion for fullstack
        development. I am not just content with my existing knowledge; I am
        always eager to learn more and delve deeper into this ever-evolving
        field.
      </p>
      <p class="p-text-secondary w-10">
        Outside of my professional life, I find great joy in running, especially
        over long distances. In addition to this, I have a deep love for playing
        padel, hitting the gym, and exploring everything related to food. These
        interests complement my dedication to fullstack development, as they
        underscore my commitment to both personal growth and the pursuit of
        excellence in my chosen field.
